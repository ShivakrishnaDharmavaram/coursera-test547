  <p class="blurb">Inheritance:-The basic idea is that you have the document object model tree. And if you specify some CSS property on some element, all the children and grandchildren and so on and so on of that element will also inherit that property without you having to specify the property for each and every element. So for example, if I specify one property on the body tag, every element that is a child of a body tag, or even a child of a child of a body tag and so on, will inherit that property. Similarly, if I specify a property on some element within my HTML page, every child and grandchild and so on of that element will also inherit that property. But obviously, no parents of that element will inherit that property and therefore will be completely unaffected by it.</p>
